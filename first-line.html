    <h1>ABOUT THE GIANT PANDA</h1>

    <p>
        The giant panda has an insatiable appetite for bamboo. 
        A typical animal eats half the day—a full 12 out of 
        every 24 hours—and relieves itself dozens of times a 
        day. It takes 28 pounds of bamboo to satisfy a giant 
        panda's daily dietary needs, and it hungrily plucks 
        the stalks with elongated wrist bones that function 
        rather like thumbs. Pandas will sometimes eat birds 
        or rodents as well.

    <h2>Behavior and Habitat</h2>
        
    <p>
        Wild pandas live only in remote, mountainous regions 
        in central China. These high bamboo forests are cool 
        and wet—just as pandas like it. They may climb as high 
        as 13,000 feet to feed on higher slopes in the summer 
        season.
